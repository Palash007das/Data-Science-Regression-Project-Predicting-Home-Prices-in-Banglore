### Why Linear Regression?

In the dynamic landscape of real estate pricing prediction, the simplicity and interpretability of Linear Regression make it an ideal choice for our project. Linear Regression is well-suited to capture the linear relationships that often exist between the key features influencing home prices, such as location, square footage, and number of rooms.

- **Interpretability:** Linear Regression provides a clear understanding of how each feature contributes to the predicted home prices. This interpretability is crucial for stakeholders seeking actionable insights into the factors influencing the housing market.

- **Efficiency:** The efficiency of Linear Regression allows for a quick training process, making it practical for real-time or frequent updates as new data becomes available. This efficiency aligns with the dynamic nature of the real estate market, where pricing trends can change rapidly.

- **Baseline Model:** Linear Regression serves as an excellent baseline model, allowing us to establish a foundational understanding of the relationships within the data. This foundation can be further built upon with more complex models, if needed.

By leveraging the simplicity and transparency of Linear Regression, our model not only provides accurate predictions but also empowers stakeholders with a clear understanding of the driving factors behind the predicted home prices in Bangalore.

#Expected Outcome:
## Anticipated Results and Insights

As we unveil the predictions generated by our regression model, we anticipate a series of outcomes that not only validate the model's accuracy but also provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Bangalore's real estate market.

### Expected Outcomes:

- **Accuracy Metrics:**
  - We will evaluate our model's performance using key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared. These metrics serve as benchmarks for the accuracy and reliability of our predictions.

- **Visual Representation:**
  - A comparative visualization of predicted vs. actual home prices will be presented. This graphical representation not only serves as a tangible validation of the model's effectiveness but also provides stakeholders with an intuitive understanding of its predictive power.

- **Insights into Pricing Trends:**
  - Our analysis will uncover potential trends and patterns in the data. Understanding how different features contribute to home prices will offer stakeholders actionable insights into the factors influencing the real estate market.

### Visual Aid: Predicted vs. Actual Prices
